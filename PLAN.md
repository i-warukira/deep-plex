# Advanced Deep Research Project Plan

## Overview
Advanced Deep Research is an intelligent research assistant that integrates interactive CLI/graphical interfaces with automated web search, content extraction, and AI-powered analysis. It leverages LangChain agents, Firecrawl for web queries and extraction, and OpenAI's language models to deliver comprehensive, iterative research reports.

## Objectives
- **Simplicity & Robustness:** Deliver a straightforward, reliable research assistant.
- **Automation:** Automate the research process from query input through data extraction and analysis.
- **Iterative Research:** Implement depth (iterations) and breadth (multiple queries per iteration) for comprehensive coverage.
- **Modularity:** Build a modular system where components like web search, extraction, and analysis can be easily improved or replaced.

## Architecture & Core Components
- **Web Search Module:** Uses Firecrawl (or similar) to query the web and retrieve URLs along with relevant metadata.
- **Content Extraction:** Extracts and cleans content from URLs. Incorporates relevance filtering.
- **AI Analysis:** Uses OpenAI models (via LangChain and OpenAI APIs) to analyze content, generate summaries, and provide follow-up queries.
- **Agent Orchestration:** An agent that coordinates multiple tools (search, extraction, analysis) for iterative research.
- **Progress Feedback:** Console feedback with progress indicators to communicate the ongoing research.

## Technologies & Libraries
- **LangChain:** For agent-based orchestration.
- **Firecrawl:** For web search and content extraction.
- **OpenAI API:** For AI-powered analysis and content synthesis.
- **Typer & Rich:** For building interactive command-line interfaces.
- **AsyncIO:** To handle asynchronous operations seamlessly.

## Similar Projects & Inspirations
Based on reference information from [Introducing Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) and similar projects:
- Many implementations focus on automated research agents which coordinate web queries and use LLMs for content analysis.
- Robust systems tend to modularize each step (search, extraction, analysis) and emphasize error handling, asynchronous processing, and clear command feedback.
- Our approach is designed as a minimal and flexible foundation that can be enhanced further based on iterative feedback.

## Roadmap & Milestones
1. **MVP Implementation:** 
   - Basic web search, extraction, and analysis modules.
   - Basic CLI interface with interactive prompts.
2. **Iterative Enhancements:**
   - Improve extraction accuracy and content relevance filtering.
   - Enhance prompt engineering and structured analysis outputs.
3. **Robust Error Handling & Logging:**
   - Incorporate detailed error reporting and retry logic.
4. **User Feedback Integration:**
   - Option to refine research reports interactively based on user input.

## Future Improvements
- Expand to support multi-modal inputs (e.g., images, videos).
- Integrate additional APIs for enriched research sources.
- Develop a richer UI/UX for non-CLI users.

## Advanced AI Agents & Advanced Reasoning

Incorporate advanced AI agents to improve reasoning, support decision-making, and enable autonomous actions during research. Leverage agent-oriented frameworks (e.g., LangChain agents) to orchestrate multi-step reasoning, critical analysis, and adaptive learning.

**Key Considerations:**
- Structured prompt engineering and reasoning chains for deeper analysis.
- Feedback loops between agent actions for iterative improvement.
- Evaluation mechanisms to assess source credibility and evidence quality.

## Ideal Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**
  - LangChain for agent orchestration and advanced reasoning.
  - Firecrawl for web search and content extraction.
  - OpenAI API (o3-mini) for AI-powered analysis.
  - Typer and Rich for interactive CLI and UI enhancements.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** asyncio for concurrent operations.
- **Containerization and Deployment:** Docker for environment consistency; Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for performance monitoring and logging.
